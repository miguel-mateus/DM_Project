Paralzyed Veterans of America is a NGO that provides programs and services for US veterans with spinal cord injuries or disease. With an in-house database of 13 million donors, PVA is also one of the largest direct mail fundraisers in the United States of America.

The proposed task is to analyze a sample of the results of one of PVA's recent fundraising appeals, containing 95412 donors. This mailing was sent to a total of 3.5 million PVA donors who were on the PVA database. 
PVA's Mission is to use their expertise to be the leading advocate for:


  Quality health care for their members;
  Research and education addressing spinal cord injury and dysfunction;
  Benefits available as a result of the membersâ€™ military service;
  Civil rights and opportunities that maximize the independence of their members.


One of the core sources of income for the NGO is the donation on the mailing lists, whether they are made sporadically, monthly, or in a personalized manner. Therefore, the leveraging of such donations becomes crucial, especially in the current times. 

The proposition for this study is to perform a  Segmentation in such a way that it will be possible for PVA to better understand how their donors behave and identify the different segments of donors/potential donors, analyzing a rich and effective marketing solution afterwards.
